Welcome to my website! I am currently an undergrad at St Olaf College. On campus I play varsity softball, am a co-president of Sports Analytics Club, and work as an admissions tour guide, game day operator, and a Calculus grader. After college I hope to work as a sports analyst for a professional sports team, preferably baseball.
